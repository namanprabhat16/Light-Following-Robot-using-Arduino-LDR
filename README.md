# Light-Following-Robot-using-Arduino-LDR
This project involves designing a robot that intelligently follows light, leveraging Arduino programming and Light Dependent Resistors (LDRs) for real-time light detection and motion control.
A Light following robot that integrates the latest smart sensing technology. Modern existence is widely reliant on technical improvements such as the ability to sense and detect light coming from a source.
This thesis will focus on the possibilities of using only light sensing devices for a tracking robot and examine the advantages and disadvantages.
The purpose is to investigate which type of light sensor is more suitable for a tracking robot and what the limitations of a tracking robot using this technology.
